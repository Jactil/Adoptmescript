This script offers a variety of features 
1. Dupe Eggs:
• Functionality: This feature allows the player to duplicate their in-game eggs.
By triggering the script, an egg in the player's inventory is cloned, providing an identical egg without reducing the original count.
2. Trade Scam:
• Functionality: This feature manipulates the trade system to freeze the pets and scam the other player. When activated, it may appear as if a valuable item is being traded to another player while actually retaining it in the user's inventory.
3. AutoFarm:
• Functionality: Automatically performs tasks and activities to earn in-game currency or items. This could involve routine actions such as collecting rewards, caring for pets, or completing age up quests without player intervention.
4. Dupe Pets:
• Functionality: Similar to the egg duplication, this feature duplicates pets. A selected pet is copied, adding another identical pet to the user's inventory.
5. Inf Bucks (new):
• Functionality: Generates an unlimited amount of in-game currency. This can allow the player to make any purchase without the need to earn currency through gameplay.
6. Make All Pets FR:
• Functionality: This feature modifies all pets in the player's inventory to have both the "Fly" and "Ride" abilities, regardless of whether these abilities were originally present.
7. Pet Spawner:
• Functionality: Allows the user to spawn any pet in the game at will. The player can choose from a list of available pets and instantly add them to their inventory.
